# Next

Next is a full-stack application built to manage to-dos. It's built with a Ruby on Rails backend, with an Angular 5 front end. NGRX is heavily used to maintain one way data flow,and responsive design is used as much as possible (just the navbar for now). The basis of taking on this project is to take a deep dive in to Angular and really get a better understanding of how the framework works.

# Features

Next offers (or will offer, coming soon) most of the core functionality one could expect from a to-do app, the ability to create, edit, and delete lists and tasks.
