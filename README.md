Notes: This is currently hosted on Heroku's free plan, which sometimes takes up to 30 seconds to load if the page hasn't been visited recently. Also, the production website resets to a blank white page on refresh. Both of these things are actively been worked on and should be resolved soon. Thanks!


Next is a full-stack application built to manage to-dos. It's built with a Ruby on Rails backend, with an Angular 5 front end. NGRX is heavily used to maintain one way data flow,and responsive design is used as much as possible. The basis of taking on this project is to take a deep dive in to Angular and really get a better understanding of how the framework works.

# Features

Next offers most of the core functionality one could expect from a to-do app, the ability to create, edit, view, and delete lists and tasks.
